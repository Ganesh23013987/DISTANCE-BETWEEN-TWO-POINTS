# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
This line imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions, including sqrt (square root).
### Step 2: 
This line assigns values to four variables: x1, x2, y1, and y2. These variables represent the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

### Step 4: 
This line prints the calculated distance, rounded to two decimal places, using the round function.
### Step 5: 
This program calculates and prints the distance between the points (10, 6) and (4, 2) in a 2D plane.
### step 6:
end program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,x2,y1,y2=10,4,6,2
dis=math.sqrt((pow((x2-x1),2)+pow((y2-y1),2)))
print(round(dis,2))
```
